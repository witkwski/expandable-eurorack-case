# Expandable Eurorack Case Prototype

### Description
- This is a concept of all-direction expandable eurorack case.
- It was designed from scratch and it is in a prototype phase.
- Nevertheless, it still feels solid and it's possible to build a robust case.
- It has been tested at least in 2x3 configuration, with not the best printing quality.

### Features
- expandable both vertically and horizontally
- solid construction
- air vent holes, with possibility to do wiring between parts
- deep enough for high modules with 2 layered PCBs

### Parts
It consists of 2 main details:
- base part + 4-screw square connectors
- side panels + angled connectors

### Size
The size of one base part is pretty custom and unusual - `29.33hp`(lol)
This is because I designed it around a specific build of `88hp` and it wasn't supposed to be used for anything else. With any 3D editor you should be able to easily change the length of the base part. `5.08 mm (0.2") = 1 HP`

### Powering
For power I used 4ms power solution, but I think you can use anything simmilar.
- [Row Power 45](https://4mscompany.com/p.php?p=989&c=6) power module
- 2x [Bus Sticks](https://4mscompany.com/busstick-shrouded.php?c=6)
- usual eurorack power cables included with modules

### Additional build details
- for the sliding nuts you need usual `3M` nuts, square shape. I used these [these](https://modularsynthlab.com/product/eurorack-slide-nuts-square3mm/)
- `3M` screws for modules, accordingly. I used [these plastic ones](https://modularsynthlab.com/product-category/diy-eurorack-case/eurorack-accessories/screws-bolts/?v=5269f4d75f5b) and Befaco Knurlies.
- for case parts connection I used `5M` black screws/nuts of 2 different lengths(`25mm` and `16mm`) for side panels and bases.
- I also used some sticky pads on the bottom to hide the holes/add some stability

I'm not a pro with 3D printers, it was my first experience.

### Contribution
Feel free to open PRs/Fork/whatever.

Possible impprovements:
- Change the width of the base part to more usual in HPs
- Improve the link system
- Design 1U rows
- ???
